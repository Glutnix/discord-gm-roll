# discord-gm-roll
A Roleplaying GM Emulator for Discord servers

You'll be able to add this Discord bot to your server and ask it yes or no questions to help run your RPG.

It's inspired by [rpgsolo.com](http://rpgsolo.com/), [Mythic GM Emulator](http://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-game-master-emulator.html), [FU: The Freeform Universal RPG](http://freeformuniversal.com/) and other GM-less roleplaying systems.

If you want a dice bot, I recommend [Sidekick](https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick/). We're not competing with this. GM Roll is going to be an emulated GM -- more of an virtual oracle than a virtual polyhedral chucker.
